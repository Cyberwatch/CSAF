# CISA CSAF Repository
In our pursuit to [“transform the vulnerability management landscape,”](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/transforming-vulnerability-management-landscape) CISA provides machine readable security advisories using the [OASIS Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) Version 2.0 standard](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/os/csaf-v2.0-os.html) for Industrial Control Systems (ICS), Operational Technology (OT), and Medical Devices. By providing machine-readable advisories using the CSAF 2.0 standard, vendors and providers of software and hardware can join CISA in taking proactive steps to enable automation and help to reduce the time required for enterprises to understand organizational impact and drive timely remediation.
