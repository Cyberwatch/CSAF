Specifically, users should: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet; Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network; When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.",
