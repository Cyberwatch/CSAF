Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.",

To\r\nexploit the heap overflow, additional protection mechanisms need to be broken. Remote access is only possible if CodeMeter is configured as a server. If CodeMeter is not configured as a server, the adversary would need to log in to the machine where the CodeMeter Runtime is running or trick the user into sending a malicious request to CodeMeter. This might result in an escalation of privilege. (WIBU-230704-01)",
